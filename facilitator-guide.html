        #Using Pixlr

        The Pixlr Editor is a free, online tool for editing photos and creating digital art. The web application looks and functions similar to Paint or Photoshop. Here are a few resources to get you started:

        * <a href="https://pixlr.com/editor/">Pixlr Editor</a>
        * Pixlr Editor <a href="https://support.pixlr.com/hc/en-us/sections/201848667-Pixlr-Editor">Support</a>
        * Understanding Layers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8NuaDKfAdk">video</a>

        ## NOTE: Learners need to download the Supporting Materials folders. Either send ahead of time (include links via eventbrite email) or paste the links on the opening slide (See “Supporting Files” column in Activity List).

        #Introduction

        ##Kick-Off Script

        Welcome to our Girls Learning Code workshop: Photo-Editing with Pixlr! We’re so glad that you could be here today and hope you’re ready to learn lots of new things.

        How many of you have been to one of our workshops or camps before?
        (If you get some hands up, ask a few of them what workshops they attended)

        We started running our first programs for kids with Girls Learning Code workshops and camps back in 2012, and then since we had so many people asking if boys could come too we started Kids Learning Code a year later in 2013. Since then, we’ve expanded to over 29 cities across Canada and have taught over 19,000 kids how to code!

        Before we get started with our workshop, there are a few things we need to go over:

        * <strong>Washrooms:</strong> Can everyone please point in the direction of the washrooms? (clarify where they are located) If you need to go to the washroom, please bring a buddy with you.
        * <strong>Water:</strong> If you brought a water bottle with you, you’re welcome to keep it on your desk, but make sure to keep the lid closed when you’re not using it. If you don’t have a water bottle, one of our mentors can help grab a glass from the kitchen later on (but please keep glasses away from laptops).
        * <strong>Break/snacks:</strong> We’ll have a 10 minute break when you can eat any snacks you brought with you or just stretch your legs. If you have a (peanut free) snack, please eat it out front and clean up any crumbs or wrappers when you’re done.


        ##Intro Slides

        ![notes](framework/img/workshop/photo-editing-notes.png)

        <br>
        #Follow-Along

        * Introduce the follow-along activity: Puppy Potter.
        * Go through each step using the slides (#31-44) while the group follows along.
        * Show learners how to save (as .PXD) and remind them to save often!


        <br>
        #Work Session

        * Select a photo-editing project from the <strong>Activity List</strong>. Halloween activity: Zombified Selfie.
        * Get learners started by creating a new project (either “Create a new image,” or “Open image from computer”).
        * Go through as many steps in the <strong>Solution Guide</strong> as you like, and ask learners for additional editing ideas
        * Remind learners to save often!
        * If learners fly through the content, create challenges for them to complete. For example, edit their head out of a photo, or put faces on inanimate objects (like candy corn) and make them come to life.

        Provide printed <strong>Solution Guides</strong> at the front for learners to bring to their seat, as needed (or refer to the digital copies that learners can access in the Supporting Materials folder).  Go through the steps together, but inform the group that they can borrow a sheet for any of the steps if they are ahead or behind the group, so they can work at their own pace. Remind them to return the sheet to the front when they grab the next one.

        <br>
        #Unplugged Activity (Optional)

        If you notice that the group is needing a break, give them 10 minutes to use the washroom, get some water, or grab a snack from their bags. Another option is to run an unplugged activity midway through the workshop to get them out of their seats and moving around. Unplugged activities usually take around 10 minutes to run. Choose an unplugged activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Do The Robot.

        <br>
        #Closing Script

        Who can tell me something new they learned today? (<strong>*Refer to slide 47 for examples</strong>. If you don’t get any hands up, you can either ask a specific kid that was definitely engaged during the workshop, or review a couple of the key lessons in the workshop)

        You all did an amazing job and we’re really impressed with how great your projects turned out.

        If you want to learn more about coding, design, and technology, go onto our site girlslearningcode.com to check out all of our upcoming workshops and join our mailing list. (Announce next workshop and give short description).

        Before we go, let’s give our mentors a big hand!

        Thanks and we hope to see you all in another workshop soon!
